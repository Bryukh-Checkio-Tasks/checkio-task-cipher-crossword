    We all know about crosswords. A cipher crossword replaces the clues for each entry with clues for each white cell of the grid -
    an integer from 1 to 26 inclusive. The objective, as any other crossword, is to determine the proper letter for each cell; in a
    cipher crossword, the 26 numbers serve as a cipher for those letters: cells that share matching numbers are filled
    with matching letters, and no two numbers stand for the same letter. All resultant entries must be valid words.

<p>
    In this task you should solve a cipher crossword. You are given a crossword template as a list of lists (2D array)
    with numbers (from 0 to 26), where <strong>0</strong> is blank cell, other numbers are encrypted letters.
    Also you have a list with words for that crossword. You should fill that template with given word and return
    the solved crossword as a list of list with letters. Blank cells replace with whitespaces (0 => " ").
</p>

<p>
    The words are placed in rows and columns only by vertical or horizontal.
    The crossword contains six words with 5 letter each. The words are placed by grid.
